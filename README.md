# Topic-modelling-of-news-article-

The exponential growth of digital content has led to an overwhelming influx of news articles across various domains. Manual categorization and analysis of this vast amount of information are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Unsupervised topic modeling offers a solution by automating the process of identifying key themes within the articles, enabling efficient content organization and information retrieval.Unsupervised machine learning techniques have gained significant traction in the field of natural language processing (NLP) due to their ability to extract valuable insights from unstructured text data. This project focuses on applying clustering algorithms, particularly Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), to perform topic modeling on a diverse collection of news articles. The goal is to uncover hidden thematic structures within the articles and categorize them into coherent topics.
